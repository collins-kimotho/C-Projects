# C Program to Create an Array of Student structs

This program creates an array of structs to store the name and GPA of four students. The struct is called Student and it has two members: name and gpa. The name member is a character array of size 12 and the gpa member is a float.

## Usage

To use this code, first compile it using the following command:

gcc student_struct.c -o student_struct
Then, run the program using the following command:

./student_struct
The program will print the name and GPA of four students.

## Next steps

- You can try to create an array of structs to store other information about a student, such as their age, major, and class year.
- You can try to use the Student struct to create a program that manages a list of students.
