# Pythagorean Theorem

This program calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

## Usage

To use the program, compile it with the following command:

gcc hypotenuse.c -o hypotenuse


Then, run the program with the following command:

./hypotenuse

The program will prompt you to enter the lengths of the two shorter sides of the triangle. The hypotenuse will be displayed on the console.

### Example
Enter side A: 3

Enter side B: 4

Side C: 5

### Notes
The program uses the sqrt() function to calculate the square root.
The program assumes that the user enters valid lengths for the two shorter sides of the triangle. If the user enters invalid lengths, the program will not output anything.
