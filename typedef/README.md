# C Program to Create a User Struct

This program creates a struct to store the name, password, and ID of a user. The struct is called user and it has three members: name, password, and id. The name member is a character array of size 25, the password member is a character array of size 12, and the id member is an integer.

## Usage

To use this code, first compile it using the following command:

gcc user_struct.c -o user_struct
Then, run the program using the following command:

./user_struct
The program will print the name, password, and ID of two users.

## Next steps

You can try to create a struct to store other information about a user, such as their email address, phone number, and date of birth.
You can try to use the user struct to create a program that manages a list of users.
