# C Struct to Store Player's Name and Score

This code creates a struct to store the name and score of a player. The struct is called Player and it has two members: name and score. The name member is a character array of size 12 and the score member is an integer.

## Usage

To use this code, first compile it using the following command:

gcc struct_player.c -o struct_player
Then, run the program using the following command:

./struct_player
The program will print the name and score of two players.

## Next steps

You can try to create a struct to store other information about a player, such as their age, position, and team.
You can try to use the Player struct to create a program that manages a list of players.
